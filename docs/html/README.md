# HTML

Zero doesn't just serve HTML as is. URLs to scripts, styles, media, and other HTML files are extracted and compiled. The references are rewritten in the HTML so that they link to the correct output files. All filenames should be relative to the current HTML file.

Zero's HTML bundler is powered by [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).
